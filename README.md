### Technologies

You'll write a single page web app.  You'll write your code in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  You won't use Ruby or backend JavaScript.

### Serving your app

You'll use a static web server (e.g. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) to serve your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.  You'll send requests to an API to get data from the Guardian and to summarise text.

- The headlines are retrieved from the Guardian Api, and the News summaries are provided by Aylien Api.
